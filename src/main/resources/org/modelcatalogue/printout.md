This will allow for more accurate recording of Morphology (SNOMED) Pathology, using SNOMED CT from 01-04-2017 and SNOMED International for historically coded cases.  Versions of SNOMED prior to SNOMED CT ceased to be licenced by The International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation (IHTSDO) after April 2017.   They also becomes a multiple repeating data item, this will allow for multiple SNOMED Morphology codes to be submitted where more than one diagnosis is reported from multiple samples in on report.:

Children’s Oncology Group Neuroblastoma Risk Grouping. http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/neuroblastoma/HealthProfessional/page3
STAGE 1: Localised tumour with complete gross excision, with or without microscopic residual disease; representative ipsilateral lymph nodes negative for tumour microscopically (nodes attached to and removed
with the primary tumour may be positive).

STAGE 2A
Localised tumour with incomplete gross excision; representative ipsilateral nonadherent lymph nodes negative for tumour microscopically.

STAGE 2B
Localised tumour with or without complete gross excision, with ipsilateral nonadherent lymph nodes positive for tumour. Enlarged contralateral lymph nodes must be negative microscopically.

STAGE 3
Unresectable unilateral tumour infiltrating across the midline, with or without regional lymph node involvement; or localised unilateral tumour with contralateral regional lymph node involvement; or midline tumour with bilateral extension by infiltration (unresectable) or by lymph node involvement. The midline is defined as the vertebral column. Tumours originating on 1 side and crossing the midline must infiltrate to or beyond the opposite side of the vertebral column.

STAGE 4
Any primary tumour with dissemination to distant lymph nodes, bone, bone marrow, liver, skin, and/or other Organs (except as defined for
stage 4S).

STAGE 4S
Localised primary tumour (as defined for stage 1, 2A, or 2B), with dissemination limited to skin, liver, and/or bone marrow (limited to infants younger than 1 year). Marrow involvement should be minimal (<10% of total nucleated cells identified as malignant by bone biopsy or by bone marrow aspirate). More extensive bone marrow  involvement would be considered to be stage 4 disease. The results of the MIBG scan (if performed) should be negative for disease in the bone marrow., max an2, 1.0, Stage 1
